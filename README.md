# Praat Scripts
These are a small part of the my praat scripts I wrote a long time ago.   
I hope they can save time for people who needs similar scripts.  

I also made my private repo available now https://github.com/rolin365/private-praat-scripts, although those were not organised or commented and some of them may not work perfectly.  
And some of them are from others.   
I will try to make them more organised.  

Here are some scripts written in python that make use of the functions in Praat (maybe using the praat-parselmouth or praatio pkgs): https://github.com/rolin365/PythonScripts
